# ScrungularWindowing
## A windows only win32 window creating library/wrapper thing (it is bad)

you need `Visual Studio` (preferably `2022`, other ones might work idk)
you need the `Game Development` and `Desktop Development` with `C++` modules insatalled
after you've done that refer to the `documentation.txt` (very usefull)

### **(CURRENTLY HAS NO FUNCTIONALITY WITH GRAPHICS API'S)**

i'm working on adding `DirectX` support (`9` and `11`?? (that is funny (i think)))
i might (wont) try and add `OpenGL` support
i dont want to add `Vulkan` support 
this is a waste of time
